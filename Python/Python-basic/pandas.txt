Pandas: Overview
Pandas is an open-source Python library used for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures and functions designed to work seamlessly with structured data like tables, spreadsheets, and time series.

Key Features
Data Structures:

Series: One-dimensional labeled array.
DataFrame: Two-dimensional labeled data structure, similar to a table.
Panel (Deprecated): Three-dimensional data structure.
Integration: Works well with NumPy, Matplotlib, and other Python libraries.

Handling Missing Data: Built-in methods to detect, fill, or drop missing values.

Flexible Indexing: Label-based and integer-based indexing.

Commonly Used Methods


Data Manipulation
read_csv(), read_excel(), read_json(), etc.: Load data from files.
to_csv(), to_excel(), etc.: Save data to files.
head(), tail(): View top/bottom rows.
info(), describe(): Summarize data.
rename(): Rename columns or rows.
drop(): Remove rows/columns.
sort_values(), sort_index(): Sort data.


Data Selection
.loc[]: Label-based indexing.
.iloc[]: Integer-based indexing.
.at[], .iat[]: Fast access for single elements


Data Cleaning
fillna(): Fill missing values.
dropna(): Drop missing values.
isna(): Detect missing values.



Data Transformation
apply(), map(): Apply custom functions.
groupby(): Group data and perform aggregate operations.
pivot_table(), crosstab(): Reshape and summarize data.
merge(), concat(), join(): Combine datasets.


Statistical Analysis
mean(), median(), sum(), min(), max(), etc.: Aggregations.
corr(): Compute correlation.
value_counts(): Count unique values in a Series.


Visualization (with Matplotlib)
plot(): Create line plots, bar charts, histograms, etc.


Applications
Data Cleaning and Preparation: Handle missing values, filter data, and reformat datasets.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Summarize and visualize datasets.
Data Transformation: Reshape and aggregate data for modeling.
Integration with Machine Learning: Prepare features and preprocess datasets for libraries like scikit-learn.
Time Series Analysis: Analyze and manipulate time-indexed data.
Database-Like Operations: Perform SQL-like joins, filtering, and aggregation.


Uses
Data wrangling in data science projects.
Financial and time series data analysis.
Automation of repetitive data processing tasks.
Handling structured data in software development.
Building data pipelines for machine learning workflows.
